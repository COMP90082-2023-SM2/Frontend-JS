## Development Guide
Currently, only the main logic of the visaulisation part has been developed, and there are lots of other features that can be developed.

For examples:
* Subgoal feature
* Step Control
* Linear animation

When you develop the new features for Planimation JS Libary, please try to modularise it. So it will be easier to maintain the front-end in future. Also, the potential user can use the relevant feature to build their application. Visualise the search tree with Planimation is a good example here.
